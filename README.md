# Simple API documentation generator

A simple conceptual API documentation generator using HTML and JavaScript. Can be a much simpler and lightweight alternative to full fledged options like [swagger](http://swagger.io/), [RAML](http://raml.org/), etc.

Can be used as it is as either a single file HTML with all dependencies, or as a multi-file with separate files for JavaScript, CSS and HTML.

##Usage:
**Single file:** Change the var config = {} section for required APIs.

**Multi file:** Change api-def.js for required APIs.

Best way to use it would be to change/enhance the formatting and API definition structure as required.
